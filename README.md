Question 1: [3 Marks]

Explain the functionality of a perceptron with its mathematical representation. Provide:

The formula for the perceptron model.

A detailed explanation of each term in the formula.

Question 2: [4 Marks]

Build and train a neural network to solve the XOR problem using any deep learning library (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch):

Define the 3-bit XOR dataset and preprocess it for model training. [1 Mark]

Design a neural network with one hidden layer. Clearly specify the architecture: [input, hidden, output]. [2 Marks]

Train the network on the dataset and evaluate its performance, reporting the accuracy. [1 Mark]

Question 3: [5 Marks]

Implement a neural network for the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset:

Design a neural network with the following architecture: [Input, hidden1(8), hidden2(4), hidden3(4), output]. [2 Marks]

Train the model on the diabetes dataset and record its performance. [2 Marks]

Provide a schematic representation of the neural network with its layers and activation functions. [1 Mark]
